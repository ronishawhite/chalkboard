Front End UI/UX

The semester project for ICSI-418 consists of a base level of required functionality that can be implemented using one of several development platforms. There is one platform that is required for implementation that one team will be responsible for. More on the platforms below. This project will be the final for the course and must be complete by the date indicated above.

The required functionality consists of a web based testing tool that can be used to manage and administer tests. The end user functionality is similar to the Blackboard quiz functionality you have experienced in this class.
